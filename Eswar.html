<h3>HTML5</h3>
<p>
              The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. 
              It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
              Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.

<h3>CSS3</h3>
<p>
              Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document
               written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).
                CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

<h3>JAVASCRIPT</h3>
<p>
              JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.
              It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, 
              supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces 
              (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures.

<h3>REACT JS</h3>
<p>
              The React. js framework is an open-source JavaScript framework and library developed by Facebook. It's used for building
              interactive user interfaces and web applications quickly and efficiently with significantly less code than you would with vanilla 
              JavaScript.

<h3>SQL</h3>
<p>
              Structured Query Language, abbreviated as SQL is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for 
              managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data 
              stream management system (RDSMS). It is particularly useful in handling structured data, i.e. data incorporating relations 
              among entities and variables.
